## My Passion for Cisco Networking

Throughout my career working with IT systems, I've maintained a deep fascination with how data flows across networks. While managing servers, applications, and endpoints has its own rewards, I've always been drawn back to the magic of routing protocols, the elegance of a well-designed VLAN structure, and the satisfaction of watching packets traverse a network I built from the ground up.

Cisco, to me, represents the gold standard of networking excellence. The IOS command line feels like home—a place where complex problems become solvable puzzles, and where abstract concepts like OSPF adjacencies, NAT translations, and spanning-tree elections manifest into real, working connectivity.
